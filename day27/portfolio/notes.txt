2 ways of sending form in portfolio page
----------------------------------------
1) put the PHP code to handle the submitted data
   at the TOP of your index.php and submit the
   form to the same page ( action="" )

2) put the PHP code to handle the submitted data
   into a NEW PHP file, submit the form to this 
   new file ( action="my_form_handler.php" ) and
   after the data has been handled (in the PHP file)
   REDIRECT back to your portfolio homepage 
   (index.html)

   <?php

   // redirects to index.html
   header("Location: index.html");
   exit(); // script ends here
